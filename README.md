A PREDICTIVE MODEL FOR WATER PUMPS STATUS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY ON DELIVERY IN TANZANIA

KEY RESULTS
    Identified the functionality of the pumps
    The model achieved 81% accuracy
    The data will enable better decision making and service delivery

PERFORMANCE OF THE MODEL
    Model Used: Random Forest Classifier
    Accuracy: 81%

Key Metrics Observed
    Fully Fuctional Pumps – F1: 0.85 | Precision: 0.81 | Recall: 0.89
    Functional But Need repairs - F1: 0.41 | Precision: 0.55 | Recall: 0.33
    Non-Functional - F1: 0.81 | Precision: 0.84 | Recall: 0.78
Conclusion: The class of pumps that are functioning but need repairs is the hardest to predict

Key takeaways for the Management Company
A significant number of non-functional pumps might have been prevented through timely intervention & preventive maintenance.

Key Predictors of Pump Failure:
    Construction Year – Older pumps show higher likelihood of failure
    Region – Geographic disparities influence functionality
    Management Type – Community or institutional oversight impacts performance
    Installer – Quality and consistency vary by installation provider
The model enables proactive identification of high-risk pumps, allowing stakeholders to forecast failures before they occur and prioritize preventive maintenance

Recommendations
Proactive Maintenance - Prioritize inspections and repairs for pumps flagged as high-risk by the model.
Targeted Investment - Direct funding and resources to regions with high failure rates to maximize impact.
Enhanced Data Collection - Train field teams and standardize reporting formats to improve data quality and model accuracy.
Digital Monitoring - Integrate sensors or mobile applications for real-time tracking and remote diagnostics.
Stakeholder Dashboard - Develop an interactive platform to visualize pump functionality, risk levels, and predictive insights.

Impact Potential
 Short-Term Benefits:
  Reduced Downtime: Minimize pump outages and mitigate water scarcity
  Optimized Maintenance: Enable efficient, predictive scheduling of repairs
 Long-Term Benefits:
  Cost Savings: Decrease long-term repair and replacement expenses
  Better Planning: Support smarter infrastructure investment and resource allocation
  Scalability: Apply the model across broader water and utility systems
